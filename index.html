      <br><br>
        My name is Kyle Tamaru and I currently attend The University of California Riverside as a freshmen undergraduate business student. In the future, my intended concentration would be finance, specifically on the corporate side. My current GPA status as of this year is a 3.8, marking me for the privilege of the deans list, an achievement that exemplifies my steadfast dedication and prowess for perfection. This commitment is not one hastily put together nor one that was somehow reached with simple classes, but rather years of personal and leadership growth. From a young age, I have been taught to commit myself to the fullest no matter the activity. I have gained valuable teamwork and communication skills from six years of baseball, ten years of musical theater, seven years of concert band, four years of marching band, and one season of Drum Corps International. All of which I excelled immensely. Those activities taught me the value of hard work and dedication to a craft. To devote so much time and effort to a single activity takes mental fortitude and a strong work ethic. My leadership opportunities also arose from my dedication to these crafts, I rose to become the brass captain of my high schoolâ€™s marching band my third year there- a position usually given to seniors- and continued to hold up until the end of senior year. The responsibility of advising and looking over 70 or more students is humbling and quick to mature any person in charge. I also had the privilege of receiving a leadership role over my one season with a Drum and Bugle corps, or the sport DCI, as a prop floor leader; my role was to safely and quickly assign members to assemble and later dismantle props from a trailer twice, or even four times a day. Any incorrect judgement or hastily made decision could easily come at the expense of the safety of the members. In terms of professional experience my ability to efficiently train marching band students with an overall enjoyable and playful atmosphere as brass captain, led to a job opportunity as a visual tech or teacher for the ensemble shortly after graduation. In my new found position, I was in charge of teaching individuals or the whole 120 plus ensemble on techniques on how to march, dance, look at stand stills, to even designing choreography for the students. It is this love for leadership and work that has helped push me towards excellence in my college academic career with a 3.8 GPA and landed me a spot on the deanâ€™s list  and in my general everyday life. These traits are some that will never leave my side and that will be valued in the business world as I try and make a name for myself. If my zealous ambitions can one day be met, then hopefully my job will be the CFO of a large company or for venture startups because I have always been fascinated in the beginnings and finishing them out to the end.
